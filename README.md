###A Marker Script Font

##About
Jimmy Stash is font with marker and handwriting features.
It is available as a open type font and webfont in three weights and currently free for private and commercial use. You can download it [here.](http://pdxiii.github.io/JimmyStash)

It is not the top legible font but it is sure fun to use for headlines or graphics which need some street credibility.

If you use Jimmy Stash I really would appreciate if you drop me a [line](mailto:sekan.pete@gmail.com).

Peace,

Pete!
