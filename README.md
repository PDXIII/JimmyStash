###A Marker Script Font

##About
Jimmy Stash is font with marker and handwriting features.
It is available as a OpenTypeFont and webfont in three weights and currently free for private and commercial use.

It is not the top legible font but it is sure fun to use for headlines or graphics which need some street credibility.

If you use Jimmy Stash I really would appreciate if you drop me a [line](mailto:sekan.pete@gmail.com).

Peace,

PDXIII!
